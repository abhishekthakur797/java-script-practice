# History and Evolution of JavaScript

- **1995**:  
  Netscape Navigator Browser decided that websites needed a programming language to add interactivity.

- **Brendan Eich**:  
  Created JavaScript in just **10 days**.

- **Initial Naming**:

  - Originally named **Mocha**, later renamed to **LiveScript**.
  - LiveScript didn't gain popularity because **Java** was a trending language at the time.
  - To leverage Java's popularity, it was renamed **JavaScript**.

- **1996**:

  - Internet Explorer (IE) was a popular browser, competing with Netscape Navigator.
  - Netscape used JavaScript, so Internet Explorer copied some features, added new ones, and created **JScript**.

- **Standardization**:  
  JavaScript was standardized by **ECMA** (European Computer Manufacturers Association), an international industry association for standardizing information and communication systems.

## Evolution of ECMAScript (ES) Versions

- **1997**: **ES1** (ECMAScript 1)
- **2009**: **ES5** (Introduced many new features)
- **2015**: **ES6/ES2015** (Biggest update in JavaScript's history)
- **2016**: **ES7/ES2016**
- **2017**: **ES8/ES2017**

## Community

- JavaScript has a dedicated community called **TC39** (Technical Committee 39) that works on its evolution and improvements.

## Compatibility

- **Backward Compatible**:  
  Features from 20 years ago still work in modern browsers.

- **Not Forward Compatible**:  
  New features introduced today won't work in older browsers unless tools like **Babel** are used to transpile modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) into older versions (e.g., ES1).

## Tools

- **Babel**: A popular tool that transpile modern JavaScript (ES6+) into older versions for compatibility.
