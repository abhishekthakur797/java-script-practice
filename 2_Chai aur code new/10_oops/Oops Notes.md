## Overview

### Do JavaScript Really Have Classes?
Yes, JavaScript does have classes. The feature was introduced in **ES6**.  
However, JavaScript is primarily a **prototype-based language**, and its classes are mainly **syntactic sugar** to make the language more familiar to developers coming from class-based languages like Java or C++.

## Key Concepts

### What is an Object?
An **object** is a collection of **properties** and **methods**.

### Why Do We Need OOP?
To avoid **spaghetti code** and leverage features inspired by other languages like Java (e.g., services), we use Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## Parts of OOP in JavaScript
1. **Object Literal**  
   - A simple way to create objects using key-value pairs.

2. **Constructor Function**  
   - Special functions to initialize objects.

3. **Prototypes**  
   - Mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods.

4. **Instances**  
   - Objects created using the `new` keyword and initialized using constructors.  
   - Use of the `this` keyword to refer to the current object.

## The 4 Pillars of OOP
1. **Abstraction**  
   - Hiding complexity and showing only the essential features.

2. **Encapsulation**  
   - Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit.  
   - Example: Using private and public properties in objects.

3. **Inheritance**  
   - Mechanism by which one object acquires the properties and methods of another.  
   - Example: Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.

4. **Polymorphism**  
   - Ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.  
   - Example: Overriding methods in derived classes.
