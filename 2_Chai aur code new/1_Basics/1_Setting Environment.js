// JavaScript was originally run on the browser by adding a script file to HTML.
// Now, JavaScript can also run standalone on the server side, similar to Python or Java.
// JavaScript is used in backend development and mobile application development as well.
// To run JavaScript standalone, you need to install Node.js or Deno.js.
// Both Node.js and Deno.js were created by Ryan Dahl.
// Deno.js also supports running TypeScript code.
// To check if Node.js is installed on your PC, open the terminal and type: node -v
// To run a JavaScript file using Node.js, type: node file.js

console.log("Welcome to JavaScript");
